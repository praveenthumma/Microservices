# API Gateway

## Intro
- Sits b/w Clients and Servers acts as a __Reverse Proxy__ routing requests b/w Clients and Servers.
- Performs various cross-cutting tasks like 
  - Authentication
  - SSL termination (SSL Offloading)
  - Rate limiting
 

## Potential problems with exposing services directly to clients:
- Client must keep track of multiple end points and handle failures in a resilient way.
- Creates coupling b/w client and backend. (like client need to keep track of all the services/nodes/IPs)
- single operation might require calls to multiple services. That can result in multiple network round trips between the client and the server, adding significant latency.
- Public facing service must handle concerns such as authentication SSL and CLient Rate limiting.
- Services with public Endpoints are potential attack surface , must be protected


A gateway helps to address these issues by decoupling clients from services. 


## Here are some examples of functionality that could be offloaded to a gateway:
- SSL termination
- Authentication
- IP allow/block list
- Client rate limiting (throttling)
- Logging and monitoring
- Response caching
- GZIP compression
- Servicing static content
