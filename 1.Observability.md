# Observability in Microservices

## 1. Why Observability is important ?

### 1.1 What is Observability
- What services a request go through and where were the performance bottlenecks ?
-  How was the execution of the request fdifferent from the expected behaviour ?
-  Why did the request fail ?
-  How did each M/s Process the request ? 

### 1.2 Why care about observability ?
#### 1.2.1 Operations Impact
- Our CPU is at 100 % in one of the clusters of servers
- or
- Your Latest deployment with this release number XXXX increased the latency for /products endpoint by 50% and its impacting 80% of the customers.

```diff
+ Goal is not to eliminate failure , the goal is to focus on recovering as quickly as possible with early and fast detection.
```


#### 1.2.2 Why Observability ?
- No need to trackdown information through 3rd party apps
- Reduced MTTR
- Increase speed of delivery ( Catch fast, fix fast and deliver fast).
- More time for DevOps.

#### 1.2.3 Things Observability can solve 
- How do I Make my app faster ?
- How can my app be more efficient ?
- Is my load balencing working properly ?
- What is my cache hit ratio ?
- How does my failure rate compare to the day before ?
- Which service is the slowest and where is the bottle neck ?

### 1.3 Logging Metrics and Tracing
#### 1.3.1 Key elements of observability
- Logging
- Metrics
- Tracing

## 2. Logging
### 2.1. Problems with logging 
- In k8s cluster each app has individual logs
- Scaling adds more conmplexity to this 
- How do you access individual logs
- logs can pile up and consume your system
- Searching logs in multiple services Grep ??

### 2.2. Centralized Logging 
- Assume 2 Apps ,  App1 and App2 
- TOols Available 
  - ELK Stack
    - Logstash (to collect logs)
    - ElasticSearch ( to search and analyze)
    -  Kibana to Visualize and manage
  - Cloud Providers
    - Splunk
    - GrayLog
    - SolarWinds Loggly
    -  Google Cloud Logging
    -  Amazon Cloud watch
    -  Azure log Analytics
