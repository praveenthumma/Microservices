# Decomposing the database
### Index 
- [Shared Database](#Pattern : Shared Database)
- 
## Pattern : Shared Database
- Logical seperation of schema
### Where to use
- Reference data which doesnot change
- Database as a Service (pattern).
#### Cons :
- Single point fo failure.

## Pattern : Database View
### Problem : Your DB is accessed by multiple external systems causing performance issues to your DB
### Solution: Present a view to the service, a projection of the underlying schema. 
- For example 
- you have a customer table with __( id, address password, Loyalty Card number).__
- your external service needs only __ID and Loyalty card Number__ .
- __Create a view__ with only __ID and Loyality card number.__
- The ability of view to project only limited information from underlying source allows us to implement a from of Information hiding.
- This reduces the reads on your main table.
